# Getting the job

A feeling I constantly had while applying to companies was "how do I know if this is the right place for me" when there are so many other companies I don't even know about. Looking back the two things that would have mitigated this feeling is research and believe in yourself and your gut feeling.

- Research
    Identify companies you'd like to work for and document them (I have a template for this that you can see [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dlRrcWmjjQVmXmZlaZEib0F93BwYLJ6SpH9l8kg9XJc/edit?usp=sharing)). The idea is to keep a record of all the companies that seem interesting to you or that you believe would align with what you'd want to do. Also, take note of what sector they're in. If there's a common theme, that can help narrow your search and lead to more discoveries. Also, write down any pros or cons you can find about the company. Keeping a record of potential companies will help keep you organised in the current search and it'll ensure you aren't starting from scratch next time you start searching again.
    
- Believe
    When you feel the way I described, just remember to believe in yourself. You know what you want. Trust your gut feeling on the company. A job doesn't have to be the greatest thing since sliced bread. It usually is what you make of it, so as long as the company isn't terrible (and believe me those companies do exist) and you enjoy what you're doing there, you'll be fine, and when it eventually isn't, leaving is also always an option. We are in a line of work where moving is easy, so take advantage of that.
    

Once you've identified a company you'd like to apply to, the next thing you need to do is get their attention. Applying through an online portal is the worst way of doing this. You need to talk to someone.
Here are the strategies I’d suggest to get you started:

- Reach out directly to recruiters/engineering leaders at your target companies, just a few each day will eventually get you some responses and intro calls. Be prepared for a lot of radio silence, though. Maybe one or two out of every ten messages you send will get a response.
- Find any mutual connections you have working at companies on your target companies list. See if you can speak with them about how they like working there. Maybe you’ll get a referral out of it, but don’t go into the conversation expecting a referral. Warm leads are the best intro.
- Turn on your “looking for work” setting in LinkedIn, so recruiters know they can contact you. Take a few recruiters' calls to see how they feel, but don’t feel pressured to work with a recruiter that’s not a good fit. They can be pushy.

This is a bare-bones but basic guide to finding a job. Some other things that you need to nail down:

- Preparing your digital footprint & cross-linking all your resources. This means portfolio, GitHub, LinkedIn, and resume should all be professional, consistent, and link to one another.
- Practice your elevator pitch. Run through the quick version of your story and experience. How can you make your resume read like a story arc?
- Be prepared for the technical questions, coding interviews, system design, etc. Be sure you can pass the phone screen and early interview rounds.

# Interview Prep

There are a few different types of interviews and you'll likely experience most of them while interviewing. I group them as follows:

- Chill
    These need very little prep before hand.
    - Recruiter chat
        This is an exploratory chat with a recruiter at the company. It is usually very informal. They tell you about the company, but make no mistake, they are also gauging you, so it's good to be attentive and engaged. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2j24vj/what_questions_to_ask_recruiter_company/) are some questions to think about. Also, see this [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4ce2s3/resource_interview_questions_my_massive/).
    - Take-home project
        This is fairly self-explanatory, you get a problem statement and a time frame to build a solution. Don't forget to add testing, documentation, make use of GitHub, add some CI/CD and code formatters.
- Eh
    These don't need much prep work, besides knowing yourself and your story, however they can bomb if you aren't focused.
    - Chat with senior developers
        This format is set to achieve the same as the technical interview, but instead of stressing everyone out with set questions that require set answers, the senior developers will have a seemingly informal chat with you, talking about your past experiences and what you know. Doing it this way gives you a chance to bring up things you know and go in-depth on it, while also allowing you to demonstrate the wider knowledge you have that isn't as in-depth yet.
    - Culture fit & soft skills interview
        This interview is to see that you're not a cave dweller. Expect questions like "Tell us about a time you had conflict in a team and how you handled it".
- Fuck
    These are all technically the technical interview, but I'm splitting them up a bit more as your technical interview could comprise multiple rounds focusing on each individually or one that mixes them.
    - System design interview
        This interview focuses on system design. The interviewers will give you a problem statement, go through it with you and give time for questions. Then they give you a time in which you need to design a system and after said time they review what you did. [This](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer) is an in-depth resource for system design and [this](https://gist.github.com/vasanthk/485d1c25737e8e72759f) is a cheat sheet for system design.
    - Whiteboard interview
        This interview will have you doing whiteboard questions. For this form of an interview, don't just jump in, give it some thought first and think out loud. The interviewers are trying to see how you think and how you problem-solve, so getting a quick answer isn't always the best. The best is to show you've thought about it and considered any constraints and edge cases and when you get stuck, there's no shame in telling them so and asking for some guidance. Some resources for this are [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com) and [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com). They do the same thing, but you may prefer one over the other. [This](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75) also seems great, although I haven't used it yet.
    - Technical interview
        This interview tests your knowledge of a bunch of things like OOP, Computer Science fundamentals, high-level system design, design patterns, log time, networking, data structures, algorithms, etc. [Here](https://github.com/CharlRitter/Interview-Notes) are the notes I used for my first job. Geeks for Geeks also has good resources on [Data Structures and Algorithms](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/learn-data-structures-and-algorithms-dsa-tutorial/?ref=shm) and [general interview prep](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/interview-preparation-for-software-developer/).

A developer I follow gave resources for various technical interview areas, which I've copy-pasted into the following block. You'll see some of them repeat stuff I also recommend:

Data Structures & Algorithms
There’s no way around it. Companies will expect you to have a basic command of data structures and algorithmic complexity.
You don’t need the full depth of a university-level, math-heavy algorithms course.
But you should have solid fundamentals…

- [CS50 algorithms primer](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/d0udgve87oi0h4m5d0lfm/qvh8h7h8l3ko9lil/aHR0cHM6Ly9jczUwLmhhcnZhcmQuZWR1L3gvMjAyMi93ZWVrcy8zLw==) — Start here if you’ve never been exposed to algorithms before. The most approachable intro, taught by an amazing teacher.
- [Data Structures Cheat Sheets](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/d0udgve87oi0h4m5d0lfm/g3hnh5he02q642ar/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGVjaGludGVydmlld2hhbmRib29rLm9yZy9hbGdvcml0aG1zL3N0dWR5LWNoZWF0c2hlZXQv) — These are a great resource and quick reference for learning about data structures and their characteristics. The cheat sheets also include example implementations where the data structure is useful.
- [Stanford Algorithms by Tim Roughgarden](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/d0udgve87oi0h4m5d0lfm/9qhzhnhge85zo7b9/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj15Uk0zc2M1N3EwYyZsaXN0PVBMWEZNbWxrMDNEdDdRMHhyMVBJQXJpWTU2MjNjS2lIN1Y=) — If you want to go deep on algorithms (and get the rigour of a university course), Tim Roughgarden is the best teacher. The entire Stanford course is available online.

System Design
Most coding interviews will include a system design portion. Especially if you’re interviewing for a more senior position.
Brushing up on system design is a critical part of the process.
For my last round of interviews, I exclusively used two resources. And they’re the ones I recommend when coaching engineers

- [The System Design Primer](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/d0udgve87oi0h4m5d0lfm/3ohphkhqk8p4p6hr/aHR0cHM6Ly9naXRodWIuY29tL2Rvbm5lbWFydGluL3N5c3RlbS1kZXNpZ24tcHJpbWVy) — The most complete resource. Use this to explore the possible topics you might be exposed to.
- [System Design Cheatsheet](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/d0udgve87oi0h4m5d0lfm/n2hohvhnl47678u6/aHR0cHM6Ly9naXN0LmdpdGh1Yi5jb20vdmFzYW50aGsvNDg1ZDFjMjU3MzdlOGU3Mjc1OWY=)— A much shorter one-pager to review concepts and get prepped for an interview.
    I recommend using both, creating study materials from them, and then writing your cheat sheet you can reference that’s written in your own words.

Skills knowledge
You’ll need to know information about your given area of expertise.
Frontend, backend, data science, mobile, etc. For those, you’ll need a broad understanding of your domain. In addition, you’ll want a deep understanding of the topics you claim to know well.

- [roadmap.sh](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/d0udgve87oi0h4m5d0lfm/48hvheh073x6xpix/aHR0cHM6Ly9yb2FkbWFwLnNoLw==) — I love this site because it has roadmaps for every speciality. No matter your interest, they’ll expose you to concepts you need to study and be prepared to talk about.
- [Data engineer roadmap](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/d0udgve87oi0h4m5d0lfm/wnh2hghrld0x04s7/aHR0cHM6Ly9naXRodWIuY29tL2RhdGFzdGFja3R2L2RhdGEtZW5naW5lZXItcm9hZG1hcA==) — The one exception is roadmap.sh doesn’t have good resources for data engineering. This roadmap aims to fill that gap.

Whiteboard Interviews
Live coding exercises are terrible. But they’re also commonplace.
If you want to get a developer job, you’re going to encounter them. So, it helps to prepare for the types of questions you might be asked.
Generally, LeetCode is the free study resource most people recommend. But which LeetCode questions should you study, and how should you review them to build your recall?
• [Grind75](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/d0udgve87oi0h4m5d0lfm/reh8hohqop6w6vt2/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGVjaGludGVydmlld2hhbmRib29rLm9yZy9ncmluZDc1)— This is an awesome tool to plan which LeetCode questions are most effective to study, given your timeline. Use it to optimize your study plan.
• [Anki](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/d0udgve87oi0h4m5d0lfm/08hwh9hmp4lglksl/aHR0cHM6Ly9hcHBzLmFua2l3ZWIubmV0Lw==)— Flashcard software with built-in capabilities for spaced repetition. This is the best way to learn anything, but it’s especially effective for improving the recall of coding questions when you’re in an interview.

[Here](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/software-engineering-interview-guide/) and [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-prepare-for-a-software-developer-interview/) are two interview guidelines you can have a look at as well. In addition to that Offerzen gave me [this](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-1tPuDNJErGrRRP10Yf_SR23_CIO0tpw/view?usp=sharing) in 2019 when signing up to the site. It's pre-WFH, so take it with a grain of salt, but maybe it helps

Always remember through the whole process that they are not just interviewing you, you are interviewing them, so ask questions that will help you know whether it's a place you'd want to work while making yourself stand out. So come prepared with some hard questions for them, like:

- How big is the engineering org in total and how is it structured? What’s the vision for its eventual structure?
- What team would I be joining or what projects do you envision me contributing to?
- What expectations would you have for the role? Is it full-stack? 3–6 months from now, if I’m doing well, what will that look like for the team?
- How do you handle onboarding and supporting new developers as they ramp on the code base?
    [Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kcrV3YTem98npY6mNZ52vDImn5DvKRb74GU5pjKHDow/edit?usp=sharing) is a bunch of questions I prepped for my interviews (never really got to all of them, so I would pick and choose what I felt was most relevant for that company)

# Wrapping Up

Please don't feel disheartened when an interview bombs. It happens. Interviewing in of itself is a skill and you'll see common threads in all of them, so as you do more, you'll feel more prepped for them.

I know you're looking at this and are thinking "wow, this is a mountain of studying I'll need to do. How can I be a developer if I need to know all this", but this isn't the all end all of what you'll need to know to be a developer. A good developer should eventually know all these things, but most don't when they start. You're more likely to feel, something more akin to "wow, I learnt all these computer science concepts, but here I am building things without using any of that knowledge" and this is a very valid thought, however later on in your career you will need to know the theory as well if you want to keep delivering more value and rise in positions.

There are two other big things I want to mention. The first is Imposter Syndrome. It is a fact of life in the developer world and you'll need to learn how to navigate it. It is the feeling that you know nothing or don't deserve your position and everyone else is so smart and fits well into their roles. Everyone feels that way. The only way to manage it is to keep learning and to keep in mind that you most likely know other things they do not, that in turn will make them feel the same way. Imposter Syndrome shouldn't scare you off but should remind you that there's always more you can learn. The second thing I want to bring up is stagnation and complacency. Stagnation is the enemy of the people. Self-reflection and constructive criticism are two of the best tools for action against this enemy. A good criticiser will give you constructive criticism, however not all criticism will be constructive. Some of it will just seem mean, so try find the truth behind the criticism and find the constructive criticism yourself. If it really is just mean or unhelpful, don't be afraid to ignore it either.

A cool resource I would recommend looking at is this [developer roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/). It visually outlines a few types of developer career paths and what you'd need to know about said career paths. Helps if you need some guidance on what you need to know or what you can work on next.

### Some other nuggets of advice:

- What size company should I be looking for?
    That depends on what you're looking to get out of it, but for a first job, avoid very small and very large companies. Being a developer means you're always learning and a job that doesn't give you that isn't advancing your career. Start-ups and very small companies can have very vague job descriptions and have you working in isolation. Having to design, build and maintain a full pipeline can teach you quickly, but it could also overwhelm you very quickly. Also working in isolation can have the same upside, but you could be teaching yourself bad habits and completely neglecting soft skills. On the other side, very large companies can have you feeling like a number and can have so many processes and procedures in place, that your personal growth isn't a priority to the company and you work on such a small set of problems that the scope of your knowledge stays very narrow. Thus always try to find a balance.
    
- The golden triangle
    There are three things that a job can give you. These three things are a good salary & benefits, personal fulfilment (think good work-life balance, satisfaction from the job you do, etc) and a good opportunity for learning and growing yourself. If the job you're working at does not tick at least two of these boxes, it might be time to reconsider working there.
    
- Remember your soft skills
    Being a developer does not mean being a wizard or a cave dweller. Quite the opposite. Any monkey can pick up coding, what sets you apart and what becomes more relevant as you become a senior is your soft skills. A developer should be able to work well in and collaborate with their team. They should be good at communication because a big part of their job is relaying information to others and presenting said information in an easily digestible manner. As one gets more senior, a developer should also be able to run projects and the team assigned to said project. They do not always complete something in the least amount of time possible, but they rather identify and complete whatever adds the most value. Thus although the job is very dependent on your coding abilities, to stand out, you need to master soft skills as well.
    
- Find a mentor
    I can not stress how helpful it is to have someone who can give you advice and guide you on your journey. They won't have all the answers, but they will have some wisdom that will help guide you on your path.
    

That's all from me for now. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions and good luck. Remember to fail fast, learn quickly, and iterate.
